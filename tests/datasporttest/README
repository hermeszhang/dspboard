Here we interface the DATASPORT interface with the BSCAN block.

The generic interface here is we create a buffer of 512
16-bit words with the length as the first word

We then can send the buffer via SPORT1. Ideally we can set things
up in a loop waiting on the fifofull signal


To check: 
[jonas@shannon XC3Sprog]$ ./xc3sprog 1 0x02 "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00" 
0 0 0 0 0 80 cd ab 

At the moment, to manually trigger a GRANT, 

[jonas@shannon XC3Sprog]$ ./xc3sprog 1 0x03 "00 80"
0 0 
[jonas@shannon XC3Sprog]$ ./xc3sprog 1 0x03 "00 00"
0 0
