The following are synthesizable and runnable tests on the
DSPboard. They are meant to be -run- on the hardware, although they
may have a simulation component. They are either for evaluation,
debugging, or assembly verification purpoess.

Suggested organization: 

Simple tests may simply have all included files in the
directory. However we recommend that complex tests have a structure as
follows:

vhdl: synthesizable vhdl code that runs on the FPGA
dspcode: dsp-running code, and similar files
sim: any simulation files for testing the VHDL module. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Tests:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

deviceloopback: simple loopback instantiation of the DeviceIO serial
module to test proper functioning of the LVDS DeviceLink, SERDES,and
associated pins

simplerun: simple FPGA basic code to bring the DSP out of reset and
give it a clock so that we may develop via the JTAG pod. Does not make
any attempt to boot the FPGA, but we do create a ldr file
that we can use once we have the main target booted

periodictx: use the eventtx and datasport interfaces to periodically
send event and data packets to everyone for the purposes of debugging
those interfaces

dspecho: use the eventtx and eventrx to set up a simple echo server
that will receive events and ping back a response
