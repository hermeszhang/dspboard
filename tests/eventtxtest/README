Simple attempt to generate fake events for the DSPboard. We can
optionally use an external stream or use an internally-generated set
of events. The external stream is to allow for post-p&R synth, the
interla one for actual implementation on the fpga.

# DSP CODE 

The DSP configures a PPI-based DMA transaction and tries to DMA in 100
events; we then examine those events to make sure stuff works.
