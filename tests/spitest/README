The Blackfin receives analog samples from an acquisition board as an
SPI slave device. The FPGA sends a burst of N samples to the board.


We're not worried about burst-DMA alignment issues (if the DMA started
in the middle of a N-word burst) because the main FPGA won't begin
signalling until the DSP has asserted the READY pin.


For our demo the FPGA simply sends, every 100 us, an SPI word of
increasing value, 0 -> (2*16-1).
