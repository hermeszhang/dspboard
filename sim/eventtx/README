To test the proper functioning of our event receiver and filter, we
generate a series of fake events:

    AEN.. DEN are 80-bit arrays that are contain the bits that enable
    reception of a given event. Each cycle they are rotated by some
    number of bits as a test vector.

    DIN: is our input value, and ouputs the ENables above on the correct
    ticks. On the first byte of the i-th event DIN = i; on the second
    byte of the i-th event DIN = 0xFF.

To test if we have tx'd and filtered the events properly, for each
assertion of EVENTENA... EVENTEND we latch the byte at that particular
moment and place it in rxdeventsA ... rxdeventsD. We also increment
the associated counter.

At the very end of the ecycle, when nothing is really going on (epos
~998) we verify that the event bytes recorded in rxdeventsA (etc.) are
correct, along with the necessary heartbeat event.
