How do we test the data output fifo?

Remember, the DataOutFifo.sendbuffer() function should always be called when the dspdataout.done() feature is done. 

That is, we should only call this once every t<T. 


First, we have a simple test: 
  1. get a buffer
  2. put data in that buffer
  3. commit that buffer
  4. have dspdataout send the buffer, read what we get
