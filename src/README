Building: 

Modules can depend on hw-specific chunks of code, which live in 
<hw/name.cc> and <hw/name.h>. 

These map, via CCFLAG, to either bf533 or host. 

Thus we can test all of our hardware-independent code without needing to use the bf533 chain. 


Testing: 
Hardware-independent tests use boost::test and live in tests/. Create one directory for each test.
