7Perhaps miss-named "software" file to design our general layout for what the hell the FPGA does:

Memory addresses:
one address to write a command



To send a command to an acq board:
There's a memory address that the DSP writes the acqboard command to, to say, change gain. Then it can read and poll. The question is, how long should it poll?

well, it can only send one command per sample interval, obviously, and _at most_ that, as we have to wait for the other one. 

maybe each DSP will have a linked list of to-acqboard? or a queue or something like that? 

Every time an acqboard event is done, we send it. 

Even CMDID for one DSP, odd for another. FPGA partitions them out. 


how to read events, given they may be being written by the FPGA? need some sort of mutex or something. 

read events, put them in an event queue, and process the queue
append to an output queue of events

FPGA: circualr buffer? something like that? 


For booting: 
   The ADSP loads 256 32-bit words (1024 bytes) in 8-bit parallel mode (running very slowly) as the loader kernel
   We can map in 2 blockselect+ RAMs for this purpose


So, the design is probably not going to fit into the -50 part. But, I only know this having sized the few sub-parts. So, 
    1. It's only an extra $5/board to go to the -100, which will fit for certain
    2. It's not very obvious at all how i could shrink it anyway
    3. i might want growth room in the future
    4. There might be some synergy from doubling up that makes it actually fit



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
EVENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, we're gonna be un-lame and re-do the event interface. Each Events component will have 2 rx fifos and 1 send fifo. 

RX fifo : 8 words/event = 32 events/block select = 64 events in queue total
TX fifo : 16 words/event = 16 events total. Yea, well, don't send a ton of events !!

This should really simplify the FSM!

We need to read MODE, MODERST, DSPRESET, RAIN, RWE, and RDIN. 

however, there's nothing wrong with having these signals pass into the CLK domain (from SYSCLK) at the last minute. However, timing for the aggregate system will be _tight_, but that doesn't mean we can't just do things combinationally. 
What if we sample EVENT to check for events to read, write, and we do all on each cyle? 
    eliminates the acknowledge issues for reading
    reading takes 7 ticks, writing 10? ouch!
    This is going to require some creative, tight FSMing
    
    we get INPUT EVENTs 


Event Input:
    updated each input cycle
    EMINE == the most recent event was for me
    EVENT : registered inputs. This is delayed by 2 ticks (as is the final output register set) to deal with clock-transition issues
           

Pipeline chart:

for this one, myaddr: 0x20
SMINE	x   x   x   x   x   x   1   1   1   0   0    0	  0   0   0   0
MINE	x   x   x   x	x   x	x   x	x   1	0    0    0   0   0   0
EMINE   x   x	x   x	x   x	x   x	x   x	1    1	  1   1	  1   1


please note that the S/R latch for SMINE is very unusual in that the SET overrides the RESET


Event output:
    ADDR[3:0] : first 3 words are targets, next 6 are data
    just write straight in
    writing the last word(ADDR=8) arms
    wait for DONE to be high before writing again. 


    So, this is interesting in that we've got to deal with the issue of too few pipeline cycles -- we need outsel to be 0, then 1, asap. 



FSM notes:
   we have simple single-states for DSP reset and boot mode setting
   I was briefly worried as to the synchronous nature of the block ram, but:
      1. most of our transactions either don't involve buffer ram (i.e. MODEEN)
	 or only write to it (DSPRAM1, etc.)
      2. ADDRB[3:0] = n occurs at state n-1, such that by state n, we will have the value on edin. 

   for an event (all events), we always write the first word to ram-- 
     this has no effect, as the addr should always be pointing to the next addr in the circular buffer
    Wow, this FSM is longer than I thought it would be. ouch. 


note that the BUFSEL line is just a decoding of the higher-order bits of the address, but in keeping with our plan to do all decoding in DSPIO, we take in this line. note BUFWR = 1 => higher chunk of address space in the buffer =>

    

FPGA must be able to decode events initially, for booting, etc. 

FPGA receive the following events:
  boot
  boot byte
  reset time
  set board ID


To accelerate the reading of events, we're actually going to store them in an async-read register set (made up of SRL16Es?) such that "NEWEVENTS" actually means "there is an event in this buffer ready for you to read!"

It requires a new FSM, but whatever. 

Our new FSM design which converts the events into an asynchronous read, coupled with moving the selection-muxes for output _in front_ of the first addr register, has given something that works at PPDUR10.


DSP side of event-interface: ---------------------------
writing an event actually writes to a series of 9 registers, 



EVENT:
   CMD = 0x01 SENDER = any dw0[0] == set into boot mode0
   CMD = 0x02 SENDER = any dw0[0] == state of DSP RESET pin
   CMD = 0x03 SENDER = any dw0 = addr of first word
			   dw1 = first word to write dw=3 last word of 3
			
			note that the addresses are a bit confusing, as they
			correspond to 16-bit values in the internal
			ram buffers, which are then read out by the DSP.
			
			We also only write 3 16-bit words (A full instruction)
			per event. 
			    
			address mapping:
			DSPaddr: 0x0000
			Event addr: 0x0000
			DSPaddr: 0x0001  Raw addr: 0x06 Event addr: 0x03

   
   CMD = 0x04 sender = timer tells us the current time, and wehther or not
		       to reset the timer.	  
		       dw0[0] = 1 == reset the timer
		       dw2  == high word of current time
		       dw3  == low word of current time
   CMD = 0x05 sender = any : memory write-in for kernel loader
   CMD = 0x06 sender = any : memory-write in response; body should be
		       original packet
   CMD = 0x07 sender = any : boot process complete. 
   CMD = 0x10 sender = any : link change (for NIC, etc. )
		       dw0[0] = 1 if link up, 0 if link down
   CMD  = 0x11 sender = any : data record / acquisition change
		       dw0[1] = 1 for acq upb
   CMD  = 0x12 sender = any. generic system state change
		      dw0 == what the relevant state change is
		      		       

   


   CMD = 0x40 - CMD = 0x4F : DSP-config events, defined in DSPasm.txt


So, for setting boot mode, we need to actually "set boot mode" and then wait for the DSP to clear it. We can't just have the DSP send an event, because the boot mode dictates that the FPGA still thinks the parallel port is in 8-bit mode.

However, if the FPGA is in 8 bit mode (expecting DATA(15:8) to be driven) and the ADSP switches to 16-bit mode, there's no harm. Then, the ADSP can write to addr(0xF000) and switch out of boot mode!!!




------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEVICE ID ASSIGNMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upon bootup, each device on the bus will need to learn its event bus ID. This is done by putting the device's ID on the event bus data lines (7:0) and triggering both EVENT and ECE. DSP boards get two IDs, the one assigned and the one after them. For example:

DSPboard is given ID 30
then Tetrode A is 30, Tetrode B is 31



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FPGA main data FIFO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a "mode" bit:
   0 == normal operation as a data fifo
   1 == just acting as RAM

Signals:
Since we've switched to a spartan-3, each blockselect ram block is 4 times larger, thus we only need buffer A to hold the boot code. This will simplify things considerably. 

Random access memory signals for booting and boot control:
RAIN[9:0] : random access address for input(writing)
RAOUT[10*:0] : random access address for output(reading) 
RDOUT[7:0] : random access data output
RDIN[15:0] : random access data input
RWE : ram write enable

instead of being the obvious fifo, we'll use 3 blockselect+ blocks to do a triple-buffered block appraoch. This will let us have 3 512-byte blocks. x2 dsps, still leaves enough for the 1 event each. 

to detect a done buffer: 
   we have a register (BUFEND) at location foo that gets written whenever the address == the address of the length field. Each "newbuffer" resets that register to 0xFFFF, i.e. "not gonna get written". We consier a frame "done" when ADDR = BUFEND and there's a write. 

buffer input side
BUFWE : write this byte
BUFADDRIN[9:0] : input address
BUFDIN[15:0] : input data to write
BUFERROR : occurs when we are in state AWAIT, and try to do a WE


buffer outputs:
BUFDOUT[15:0] : output data
BUFNEXT: input to say "gimme the next frame"
BUFACKOUT : high when BUFDOUT is a valid byte. 

the output of this system is very similar to what's needed to talk to the data bus, to modularize that functionality and save myself some work. 


CLKA : clock on the DSP side
CLKB : clock on the data bus side

For internal data frames, the "length" argument is in 2-byte words, always includes the total frame length, and is preceeded by a 2-word header that looks like:
word 0:
bits 5:0 : source ID (tetrode number
bit 7:6 : type (spike/eeg) spike = 0, eeg = 1

word 1: 
bit 9:0 : total length of frame in 2-byte words (0 == 1024 == 2048b)




Data Mux:
   Simply alternates DATAENs between the two buffers
   NEXTA or NEXTB == not DATaEN, i.e. NEXTn is assert-high
   ACK = not ACKA, because again, we go from assert-high to assert-low
 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TIMER INTERFACE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We get the global TINC signal, and the "RESET CLOCK" event. 

There is the system-wide TINC signal, which is clocking along at SYSCLK, and is a single tick. 

When we get an EVENT with ID = 4 , we will reset the clock the next time we get a TINC. 

The output of the TINC signal is delayed by three ticks, allowing the RX of the appropriate event to arm the TCLR flag. 




 





------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADSP EXTERNAL MEMORY INTERFACE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Booting occurs in 8-bit mode, which uses the ALE cycle to put the 16 MSBs of a 24-bit address on the line. Thus during boot, we see ADDR on the FPGA == 0x0800. 

We use the inbound RD\ to control the TS. When RD = 1, the DSP isn't reading, therefor we're not writing, and thus the output should be tristated. This results in us tristating as quickly as possible following the RD cycle. What a neat idea!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FPGA FIBER RX / TX
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We want to be able to receive command updates, send commands, and send an event when there are lots of errors, or something like that. 

How do we tell the difference between "lots of errors" and "no cable connected"?
Solution: you don't. Every error you get triggers a "disconnected" state

You only reconnect when you get two straight frames of no error. 

the transition from disconnected to connected causes us to generate an event, but we'll let the DSP (which is polling the connected bit) handle that. 

we just read in bytes, count up
if we get an error, reset counter, change status from sync to nosync
dsp flushes buffers


Normally, the command interface just sends out frames full of zeros. But should it get a command, it will write it out once. 

We just do this as a big FSM, which is conditioned on OUTBYTE. Simple stuff. 

CLK8 is an 8 MHz CLKEN, and OUTBYTE = 10x CLK8


However, in this scenario, what happens when two DSPs try to writean event at the same time, we get a race condition. DSPA fills up its registers, DSPB fills up its regs, and we send them one after another. 

One solution is to make the FPGA wait unitl the cmdevent is updated to switch to querying the other DSP. The problem then becomes... what happens if the event never arrives???? We can handle the disconnect state just fine, but what if the acqboard crashes, or something like that.... 

We will have a watchdog "Acqboard timeout timer" on the fiber TX section. 
Protocol is (again, symmetric wrt DSPs)
1. if DSPA wants to send an event, send event
   wait for CMDID update = DSPACMDID
   if ACQTOUT = acqmax then 
      set acqboardtimeout status bit for DSPA
      bit is only cleared by another write from the DSP
   end if
2. process DSPB using a similar metric. 
  

Basically, the idea is that:
   Both DSPs can write at once, but the FiberTX FSM will handle one at a time
   Acqboard oddities will be handled thanks to a watchdog timer, which will invalidate the current event-writing and cause a transition to the trying to service the next DSP
   
      



	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FPGA interface to Acq Board
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Need some way of partitioning the events as they come in
some way of passing updated cmd bytes to the dsp
some way of interpreting the writes to the cmd word as, well, commands
