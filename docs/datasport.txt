Data packets are received via SPORT1 in a bit-serial manner. The Data
interface is dominated by the maximum data packet size, MAXDATAN.

SPORT1 is configured as: 

external clock
no frame sync
RFS is externally generated

We're limited by FPGA resources to using a single BRAM, which means we
have a maximum of 1024 bytes per packet.

We use the FRAME SYNC to indicate 8-bit bytes. We use a FLAG to frame
the 1024-byte frame.

We can store two packets in here; we need to be careful about our FIFO
FULL signal. We could always use a 2-bit up-down counter or something. 

Format: 

The 16-bit data is transmitted big-endian, as:

LEN[15:8]
LEN[7:0]

SRC
