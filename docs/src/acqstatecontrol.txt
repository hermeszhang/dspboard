AcqStateControl: The control interface for the acqboard state, that serves
as a local proxy. 

Challenges: 
  1. We're sharing the acqboard with another DSP, and must react accordingly, 
     only using the subset of the CMDIDs that are ours
  2. We'd love to work at other modes, because we want to be able to
     acquire the sample buffers, test out filters, etc. 
     But mode changes are particularly problematic


acqstatecontrol.linkchane(function to call when link state changes)
acqstatecontrol.modechange(function to call when mode changes)

and then you have 
bool acqstatecontrol.setGain(chanmask, value, callback, handle)
bool acqstatecontrol.setHPF(chanmask, value, callback, handle)
bool acqstatecontrol.changeMode(mode) 

Note that the AcqStateControl can only process a single command
at a time.

implementation

Internally we have : 
bool    pendingCommand : is there currently a command pending
char[]  currentMask : mask of the channels the current command 
        currentOP : current operation 
        currentMaskPos : current channel we're working on / waiting on
char    pendingSerialCMDID : commandid we're currently waiting for
bool    pendingSerial : what's the serial command we're waiting for
