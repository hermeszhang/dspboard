EventTX:  The low-level hardware interface that handles
transmission of events. 

newEvent(const EventTX_t &): 

convert to DMA-able form
stick in internal FIFO which is just a static array of bytes
We then just periodically call eventtx.send() which will send
any available events if possible


Under no circumstances should you ever instantiate more than one of
these.
