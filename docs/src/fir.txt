The FIR FilterLink performs simple convolution on incoming data. 

Things to watch out for: 
   * the input buffer from the data source must be long enough
     to support the filter 
   * This must be fast, and really only supports signed ints
   * how do we wrap? inline asm? 


AD EE-186, Extended-Precision Fixed-point arithmetic, suggests we can
get ~31-bit answers with 

C + 2T
ticks, where T is the # of taps. 

and C ~50 

this means that for a 128-tap filter for
each of the 5 channels, we need
5 * (128 *2 + 50)  = ~150 ticks
