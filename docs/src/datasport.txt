The DATA Sport interface takes in some sort of data object, serializes
it into an internal buffer, and then sends out the buffer. 

We must periodically call the sendPending() method to check if the
FPGA's fifo is not full, and if not, push a datagram into there

Note that BUFSIZE and BUFLEN are not very large. 

Also, the toBuffer(char *) method of the object takes care of copying
the object into the buffer pointed to by the argument pointer.
