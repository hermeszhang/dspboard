The TetrodeSink is the sink for the TSpike

It has a few parameters, some compile-time, some not

PRETRIGGER: how many samples to record pre-trigger
POSTTRIGGER: how many samples to record post-trigger

thresholds: the thresholds for each channel

We keep an internal circular buffer of size PRETRIGGER + POSTTRIGGER
for each channel.

We read FILTID from the connected filter...

This is actually a bit tricky, as dataout takes in an object
and then calls it's toBuffer pointing to the target char
array. 

So we're going to do this somewhat gross little hack and have
our TSpikeData_t's fields simply point to the relevant locations
in the sample buffers, along with lengths
