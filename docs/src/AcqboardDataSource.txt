Acquisition board data source: 


1. keep track of acqboard state
2. send commands
3. handle link status

Constructor takes in a reference to an AcqSerial, either an A or B constant, and an EventSink. 


Completely hardware-agnostic, but can/does parse acqserial streams

maintains acq state

setGain(chan, val)
setInputHw(chan, val)
keeps track of max-range, min range
has internal channels, which we work with


To change an acqboard setting we: 
send the event
set "pending event" 
wait for update
upon update send state info

Input events for AcqboardDataSource 

setGain
setInputFilter

for acqboard-changing commands, we :
  1. send out the command
  2. wait
  3. when we receive the update, make the necessary changes
