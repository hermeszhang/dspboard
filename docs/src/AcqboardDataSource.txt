Acquisition board data source: 


1. keep track of acqboard state
2. send commands
3. handle link status

Constructor takes in a reference to an AcqSerial, either an A or B constant, and an EventSink. 


Completely hardware-agnostic, but can/does parse acqserial streams

maintains acq state

setGain(chan, val)
keeps track of max-range, min range
has internal channels, which we work with


To change an acqboard setting we: 
send the event

Input events for AcqboardDataSource 

setGain
setInputFilter

so we have some top-level function that does sanity checking: 

setGain(int chan, int value)

then we have some send Command function which actually assembles and
send the command

1. create the command
2. put the command on the wire
3. set the pending cmdid
4. wait for completion

We'd like to have the nonce update process be abstracted
