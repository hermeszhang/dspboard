This is the very low-level interface to the acquisition board serial stream.

we have two structs: 


AcqFrame:
  uint8_t cmdsts; 
  uint8_t cmdid; 
  uint16_t samples[10]

AcqCommand:
  uint8_t cmd; 
  uint8_t cmdid; 
  uint32_t data; 


We have a class AcqSerial() which:
1. sets up the SPORT DMA
2. installs the necessary interrupt handlers
3. creates the various DMA memory spaces

.checkRxEmpty() -- are there any current samples? 
.getNextFrame(*AcqFrame) -- copies the data into an AcqFrame
.sendCommand(const & acqCMD)

should the "link go down...."
