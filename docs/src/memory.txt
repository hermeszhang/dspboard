We build our own malloc() and free() here. 

We do this by taking a starting address, a chunk size, and
a chunk  count. 

Then we create an array of chunks on the heap starting at the address
and an array of size_t integers

Potentially, non-stack allocation is slow, because we have to walk the
chunk array. This is why, in general, we should only create things
once, and hopefully never delete them.

256-byte chunks. This means we get 128 of them.
