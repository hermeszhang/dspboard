The EventRXDispatcher reads events from the EventRX interface and then
dispatches them to various callback-able objects based on the cmd (not
the src).


The interface goes something like this:


EventRXDispatcher(EventRX* ) [constructor]
.registerDispatch(eventcmd_t, callback) (possibly via boost::bind)
.nextevent() : primary loop function, reads and dispatches a single event, 
or does nothing

We use an internal function pointer table to do the relevant dispatch,
and initialize this table to null. We must always check
to make sure there's no null pointer.
