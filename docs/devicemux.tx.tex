The TX half of the DeviceLink Mux interfaces between event and data FIFOs and the output DeviceLink module. 

It: 
  1. determines which device has its DGRANT asserted, and responds
  2. if there is pending data, sends it
  3. if there are pending events, sends them

We have dedicated SendEvent modules and SendData modules which handle all of the actual interfacing with the fifos -- this module is mostly a multiplexing step.
