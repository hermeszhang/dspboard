Event transmission to the DSPs takes place via the shared 8-bit wide
parallel port (PPI) interface.

We blit each event frame directly into the DSP, and the 
DSP knows whether it's an A, B, C, or D dsp, and reads the 
event mask and then dispatches the events. 

This interface is very small on the FPGA side, and there's not too
much overhead on the DSP side...
