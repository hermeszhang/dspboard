Event transmission to the DSPs takes place via the shared 8-bit wide
parallel port (PPI) interface.

We use the eventtx-Filter module to extract out the headers from the
event stream and then selectively assert a DEN during the relevant
event in the ECYCLE data stream (with a two cycle latency)

This DEN selectively enables and disables events that are targeted for
the device whose header begins at ESEL.

This interface is somewhat ugly and a bit of a hack; I'm not entirely
sure I'm happy with it.
