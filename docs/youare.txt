How do we tell the devices who they are ? That is, how does
a device, fresh out of reboot, learn of its deviceid? 

We send the YOU ARE event, cmd = 0x01, to the device to tell 
it who it is. 

In the case of the DSPboards we will send a series of configuration
bytes over the DSPBOARD UARTTX interface
