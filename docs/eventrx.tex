The EventRX interface uses the DSP's SPI interface in slave mode to
acquire events to place onto the event bus. While there is a FIFO
involved, it's important to note that the DSP should rate limit its
event transmission to roughly one event per ECYCLE to prevent overflowing the bus. 

We use a 16-bit word interface with the upper byte being an address in
the fifo to write to. Note that there only the bottom 32 locations
have any meaning.

We also make sure this entire interface can be bypassed for the
optional ``booting of the DSP''

We use SPISEL4 to select/enable/cs the FPGA.
