The DSPs read samples from the acqboard via SPORT0. We transfer in 11
16-bit samples, the 10 acquired from the acqboard as well as the
CMDSTS and CMDID bytes.

The acqboard's 8 MHz 8b/10b signal is deserialized and decoded by the
decoder module, and the frame disassembly module selects out the
individual 16-bit samples.

The arrival of a complete, error-free frame causes the assertion of
NEWSAMPLE, which updates FrameSerialize's internal registers.
