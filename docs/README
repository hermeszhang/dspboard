Okay, this is getting nowhere; I really need to reevaluate how I'm organizing this documentation, with an eye towards "what audience?"


Who would the audience be? 
1. someone who wanted to fix a bug
2. someone who wanted to know how the DSPboard worked
3. someone who wanted to add a custom filter
4. someone who was curious why I made decision foo
5. me, in two years

How to have documentation organized in a manner that won't be painful for everyone involved, and will also serve as a canonical reference for this sort of thing? 

This is our first documentation, and it will be a model to follow for others. 

What do we want? 

1. an event reference of some kind
2. a general overview of wtf the DSPboard does
3. documentation of interfaces: 
   a. fpga/DSP
   b. FPGA/acqboard
4. notes on how the code actually works
5. how to boot the fucking thing
6. how to talk to the DSPboard internals
7. Hardware design decisions, schematic annotations, etc. 
8. FPGA internals
9. 


Okay, new plan: 
1. dsp board introduction: 
   a. what does it do
   b. how does it do it
   c. general hardware overview
      - signal processing chain
      - what do things like trigger len, etc. mean
      - downsampling
2. Event interface for normal operation
   Four segments: 
   1. acqboard control
   2. filter settings
   3. thresholding and spike windowing
   4. buffer/filter configuration
   5. Timing 
   6. Boot 

3. FPGA/DSP memory mapped interface, specific pins, etc. 
   do any of the above parts depend on understanding TINC/TCLEAR? No
   or the specific interrupts? no
   So, this shows how tinc/tclear works
   Boot details ? 
4. FPGA Internals
    CMDID altenration
    Software layout and configuration
    
5. DSP code internals
    Which registers are which 
6. Hardware, schematics, etc. 
    Power and part selection
