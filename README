The DSPBoard is the 4-DSP signal processing module that 
performs the majority of the per-channel signal processing in soma. 

Directory structure: 

boot/       : Code for boot CPLD on device
docs/       : documentation, design, and protocols
iolib/      : C++ library for parsing and processing events
sim/        : vhdl unit tests 
solidmodel/ : SolidWorks model of the DSP board and mounting hardware
src/        : DSP code 
src/tests   : unit tests for c++
tgt/dspboard : buildable code for actual dspboard targets

At the moment I think we're going to support two targets, 
"tetrode-ad" 
and "raw-continuous"
