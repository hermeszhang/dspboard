ERIC,

The two equations in question are absolute worst case, they assume that all of the input current is sourced in equation 1 by the 10 uF bypass cap.  This is a low ESR ceramic type and the ESR is ignored.  In equation 2, it is assumed that all the ripple current goes thru the bulk cap.  This cap is typically some type of electrolytic, so the ESR is taken into account.  In real life, the ripple currents are shared, so the actual measured voltage will be smaller than what is calculated.  Also, depending on the output impedance of the source supply, some of the ripple current will be shared by that supply.  If the designer is going to distribute the SWIFT devices on his backplane so that each one is located adjacent to the daughter card slots, each SWIFT should have a 10 uF bypass ceramic X5R or X7R directly across the VIN and PGND leads as close to the device as possible.  One bulk capacitor at the point where the external PSU is connected to the backplane.  It is probably not necessary to have an individual bulk cap for each SWIFT, perhaps 4 distributed along the backplane would suffice.  Sanyo OSCON works well, they have low ESR.

In general, if all the SWIFT devices were synchronized, the ripple currents would add and the resulting ripple voltage would increase.  In this case, the SWIFT internally compensated devices have no sync capability, so the current from each will be randomly out of or in phase, sometimes adding, sometimes not.

Let me know if I can be of further help.

Regards,
Hanumantha

Hi! Sorry, my question may have been a bit poorly-defined. I have a
backplane that has already been committed to implementation, I.e. I can't
change anything on the backplane.

This backplane is supposed to aggregate the data from 16 DSP cards, and
provides each card with 3.3V, 2A. Now, the source of the backplane's power
is a 40-A switching PSU, an off-the-shelf module that has some output
ripple of  it's own.

The reason the 16 Switching regulators will be in parallel is each will be
getting its power from the backplane. Only their inputs will be in
parallel, not their outputs.

Attached is a diagram.

Now, going off of equation 1 from app note SLVA111, the delat-Vin, i.e.
"The maximum peak-to-peak input voltage without a bulk capacitor", is (at
500 kHz switching and with Iout = 1.5A) 75 mV.

As I understand it, this is ripple that the switching regulator
_contributes_ to the output by causing a current inrush every 500 kHz.
This suggests that connecting a large number of these inputs in parallel
would create a  problem, as there would be (for my application, 16) 500
khz switching supplies potentially cuasing 75 mV of supply ripple each, or
1.2 V of supply ripple total.

Now, equation 2 of the same app note suggests using a bluk capacitor to
reduce ripple. But the Iout(max)*ESR(max) term pretty much guarantees that
this won't actually _reduce_ ripple, as I can't seem to find any
capacitors for which  the ESR < 0.1 ohm, and 1.5A * 0.1 ohm = 150 mV of ripple, or double our
initial, no-bulk-capacitor result.

So I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to connect a bunch of these
daughtercards to the backplane without having horrible input ripple
problems. Any ideas?
          ...Eric

> I'm designing a DSP daughtercard to interface with a backplane that provides 3.3V 2.5A. I have a bunch of components on the board that need lower voltages, but I'd really like the energy efficency of a buck converter. Will it be a problem to have 16  identical DC/DC converters in parallel (one on each card?) Unfortunately, I can't redesign the backplane. I'm especially worried about the effects of input ripple.
